          course's website itself describes it:

        <blockquote cite="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">
          "Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of
          computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and
          non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.
          This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without
          code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include
          computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and
          computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts,
          humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to
          program in one language, this course teaches you how to program
          fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The
          course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that
          underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about
          functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how
          computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The
          course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll
          understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course
          introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps
          alike. Course culminates in a final project."
