# Homepage

Homepage is a project for Week 8 of Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course, which consists of building a simple [homepage](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) with multiple pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap. In this website I share a bit about myself and my experience with CS50, such as the topics I learned about throughout the course and how my learning journey affected the way I think about programming!

## Process

The design was inspired by CS50's own website, taking a mobile-first approach to create a responsive layout. Instead of each page having it's own HTML file, I decided to make it a SPA (Single Page Application), by creating each page in JavaScript and dynamically updating the HTML with them as the user navigates through the website. Bootstrap's [collapse](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/collapse/) component was used alongside a menu button to make a collapsible nav element for the mobile layout.
